## Javascript to Typescript - A Typed and Stylish Transformation! âœ¨

## Description

This frontend project, originally built with pure JavaScript, has undergone a complete metamorphosis! Now, in addition to enjoying the robustness of TypeScript, it also boasts the elegance of Bootstrap and the organization of Object-Oriented Programming. ðŸ’ªðŸŽ¨

The HTML structure, while still familiar, is now adorned with Bootstrap classes and components. Meanwhile, the code, fully migrated to TypeScript, is organized into classes and objects, making maintenance and evolution a walk in the park. ðŸŒ³

## Motivation

The shift to TypeScript, Bootstrap, and Object-Oriented Programming was driven by the following goals:

* **Improve Maintainability:** Static typing (TypeScript), well-organized code (OOP), and reusable components (Bootstrap) make the project easier to understand and maintain.
* **Reduce Errors:** TypeScript identifies errors at compile time, while OOP promotes code reuse and minimizes the chance of inconsistencies.
* **Increase Reliability:** Strong typing and well-structured code enhance the application's reliability.
* **Modern and Responsive Interface:** Bootstrap provides a sleek, responsive, and easy-to-maintain user interface.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:**  Structure of the interface, now enhanced with Bootstrap.
* **CSS:**  Styling and layout of the application, simplified by Bootstrap.
* **TypeScript:**  Main frontend language, ensuring static typing and increased security.
* **Bootstrap:** CSS framework that offers ready-made components and responsive styles.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Programming paradigm that increases code organization and reusability.
